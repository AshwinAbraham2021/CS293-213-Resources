# CS 213+293 Resources

These are a collection of resources for the courses CS 213 (Data Structures and Algorithms) and CS 293 (Data Structures and Algorithms Lab).

The resources for CS 213 comprise of the slides for Prof Naveen Garg's Lectures and some miscellaneuous implementations of some of the Data Structures and Algorithms he discusses in those lectures (these were implemented in C/C++/Java).

The resources for CS 293 comprise of the lab problems given to us and my solutions to those problems.

I hope these prove useful to you!
